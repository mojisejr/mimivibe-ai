## 🏷️ Logo Integration Strategy

### Logo Asset Information

**Location:** `src/public/images/logo.webp`  
**Format:** WebP for optimal performance  
**Fallback:** PNG format for browser compatibility  
**Purpose:** Brand identification and trust building across all user touchpoints

### Logo Usage Guidelines

```typescript
const logoIntegrationStrategy = {
  // Primary Brand Touchpoints
  headerLogo: {
    size: "32px x 32px",
    placement: "Chat header, navigation bars",
    style: "Rounded corners, subtle shadow",
    purpose: "Primary brand identification",
  },

  // Welcome/Entry Points
  welcomeLogo: {
    size: "64px x 64px",
    placement: "Welcome screens, onboarding",
    style: "Centered, prominent display",
    purpose: "First impression and trust building",
  },

  // Modal/Overlay Branding
  modalLogo: {
    size: "48px x 48px",
    placement: "Payment modals, confirmation dialogs",
    style: "Subtle, non-intrusive",
    purpose: "Brand reinforcement during key actions",
  },

  // Footer/Secondary Areas
  footerLogo: {
    size: "24px x 24px",
    placement: "Footer, secondary navigation",
    style: "Minimal, clean",
    purpose: "Consistent brand presence",
  },
};
```

### Logo Component Implementation

```typescript
// Reusable Logo Component
const Logo = ({
  size = "md",
  className = "",
  showText = true,
}: {
  size?: "sm" | "md" | "lg" | "xl";
  className?: string;
  showText?: boolean;
}) => {
  const sizeClasses = {
    sm: "w-6 h-6",
    md: "w-8 h-8",
    lg: "w-12 h-12",
    xl: "w-16 h-16",
  };

  return (
    <div className={`flex items-center space-x-2 ${className}`}>
      <img
        src="/images/logo.webp"
        alt="MiMiVibes"
        className={`${sizeClasses[size]} object-contain`}
        loading="lazy"
        onError={(e) => {
          // Fallback to PNG if WebP fails
          e.currentTarget.src = "/images/logo.png";
        }}
      />
      {showText && (
        <span className="font-semibold text-base-content">MiMiVibes</span>
      )}
    </div>
  );
};
```

### Logo Placement Strategy

```typescript
const logoPlacement = {
  // Primary Locations
  primary: {
    chatHeader: "Left side, next to 'แม่หมอมีมี่' text",
    welcomeScreen: "Centered above Mimi avatar",
    paymentModals: "Top-left corner for brand trust",
    errorPages: "Centered for brand reassurance",
    loadingStates: "Centered with loading animation",
  },

  // Secondary Locations
  secondary: {
    bottomNavigation: "Minimal logo in center",
    profilePage: "Header branding",
    historyPage: "Page header",
    packagesPage: "Trust indicator in payment section",
  },

  // Contextual Usage
  contexts: {
    trustBuilding: "Show logo prominently for security trust",
    firstImpression: "Large logo for welcome experience",
    brandConsistency: "Small logo for navigation elements",
    errorRecovery: "Show logo to maintain brand connection",
  },
};
```

### Mobile-First Logo Strategy

```typescript
const mobileLogoStrategy = {
  // Minimum touch target: 44px
  minimumSize: "44px x 44px",

  // Responsive breakpoints
  breakpoints: {
    mobile: "32px x 32px",
    tablet: "40px x 40px",
    desktop: "48px x 48px",
  },

  // Performance optimization
  loading: "lazy",
  format: "WebP for performance",
  fallback: "PNG if WebP fails",
};
```

### Logo Integration in UI Components

  format: "WebP with PNG fallback",
  loading: "Lazy loading for performance",
  sizing: "Responsive sizing with Tailwind classes",

  // Accessibility
  altText: "MiMiVibes logo",
  contrast: "Works with existing color scheme",
  focus: "Proper focus indicators for keyboard navigation",

  // Mobile Optimization
  touchTargets: "Minimum 44px touch targets",
  responsive: "Adaptive sizing for different screen sizes",
