# Current Focus Session

**Started**: 2025-09-12 (Thailand timezone)

## Session Context

Card representation in the `@src/app/ask/components/AnimatedArticleDisplay.tsx` has got some bugs. Need to put some console.log and check how the data comes before display, and fix the card representation from there. 

**Scope**: Focus ONLY on this problem - don't implement any other features but fix this error.

## Investigation Areas

1. **Data Structure Analysis**: Check how card data is structured when it arrives at the component
2. **Console Logging**: Add strategic console.log statements to trace data flow
3. **Card Representation Issues**: Identify specific bugs in how cards are displayed
4. **Bug Fixing**: Fix the identified card representation issues

## Files to Focus On

- `src/app/ask/components/AnimatedArticleDisplay.tsx` - Primary file with card representation issues

## Session Scope Limitations

- ❌ No new feature implementation
- ❌ No refactoring beyond fixing the bug
- ❌ No other component modifications
- ✅ Only fix card representation bugs
- ✅ Add debugging console.log statements
- ✅ Analyze data structure issues

## Current Status
