## ✅ RESOLVED: Core Prediction System Recovery Complete

### Recovery Summary
**Status**: ✅ **FULLY RESOLVED** - All critical systems restored and operational

Successfully completed comprehensive 5-phase recovery of core prediction system `/ask` that was failing due to missing security monitoring database tables.

### Root Cause Identified & Fixed
- **Issue**: Missing `prompt_access_logs` and `security_alerts` database tables
- **Cause**: Database introspection removed security tables that weren't properly mapped
- **Solution**: Re-added security tables to Prisma schema and ran migration

### Systems Restored

1. **✅ Database Schema Recovery**
   - Added missing `PromptAccessLog` and `SecurityAlert` tables
   - Migration `20250911153030_add_security_monitoring_tables` applied successfully
   - All database relationships properly restored

2. **✅ Prompt Management System**
   - Verified 3 prompt templates exist and accessible
   - AES-256-GCM encryption system operational
   - Prompt Manager CLI tools functional

3. **✅ Security Monitoring System**
   - PromptSecurityMonitor can now query security tables
   - Real-time access logging restored
   - Threat detection and alerting operational

4. **✅ Core /ask Endpoint**
   - Integration tests confirm proper authentication flow
   - Workflow-with-db (encrypted) system active
   - Error handling and credit validation working

5. **✅ System Validation**
   - TypeScript compilation: ✅ No errors
   - Database connectivity: ✅ All tables accessible
   - Development server: ✅ Running properly

### Technical Implementation
- **Branch**: `feature/115-core-prediction-system-recovery`
- **Migration**: Added security monitoring tables with proper indexing
- **Validation**: All systems tested and confirmed operational
- **Impact**: Zero data loss, full functionality restored

### Next Steps
Ready for PR creation and deployment to restore full production functionality.
