# Round 10.1: Payment History Implementation - Sub-Round Prompt

## 🎯 Mission Statement

Implement a comprehensive Payment History page that allows users to view their complete payment transaction history with filtering capabilities. This sub-round leverages existing infrastructure (85% ready) to deliver high business value with minimal technical risk.

## 📊 Context Analysis Summary

**✅ Existing Infrastructure (85% Complete):**
- PaymentHistory + Pack database tables fully implemented (100% match with design spec)
- Stripe payment integration with webhook handling complete
- /history page structure and ReadingCard component patterns ready for adaptation
- UnifiedNavbar, routing, and mobile navigation systems established
- DaisyUI + MiMiVibes theme conventions and responsive design patterns

**❌ Missing Components (15% Remaining):**
- `/api/payments/history` endpoint with filtering and pagination
- Payment history frontend components and hooks
- Navigation integration for payments route

## 🎯 Implementation Tasks

### Task A: API Endpoint Implementation (1 hour)
**Objective:** Create `/api/payments/history` endpoint with robust filtering and pagination

**Requirements:**
- Query parameters: `page`, `limit`, `startDate`, `endDate`, `packId`, `status`, `search`
- Response format matching PaymentHistoryResponse interface from design spec
- Pagination with `hasNextPage`, `hasPreviousPage`, total counts
- Summary statistics: `totalAmount`, `totalCredits`, `totalTransactions`, `successRate`
- User-scoped data (only show payments for authenticated user)
- Proper error handling and TypeScript compliance

**Implementation Pattern:**
```typescript
// Copy pattern from /api/readings/history/route.ts
// Add Prisma query with PaymentHistory.findMany()
// Include Pack relation for package details
// Filter by userId from Clerk auth()
// Add date range, status, and search filtering
// Return paginated results with summary statistics
```

### Task B: PaymentHistoryPage Component (2 hours)
**Objective:** Create main payment history page following existing /history pattern

**Requirements:**
- Copy structure from `/src/app/history/page.tsx`
- Integrate UnifiedNavbar with proper page title
- Add PaymentSummary component for statistics display
- Include PaymentFilters component for search and filtering
- Implement PaymentCard grid layout with responsive design
- Add loading states, empty states, and error handling
- Use usePaymentHistory hook for data management

**Component Architecture:**
```typescript
/src/app/payments/
├── page.tsx                     // Main payment history page
├── components/
│   ├── PaymentHistoryPage.tsx   // Main container component
│   ├── PaymentCard.tsx          // Individual payment card
│   ├── PaymentFilters.tsx       // Filter controls
│   └── PaymentSummary.tsx       // Summary statistics
```

### Task C: PaymentCard Component (1 hour)
**Objective:** Create individual payment card component adapting ReadingCard design

**Requirements:**
- Adapt `/src/components/history/ReadingCard.tsx` structure
- Display: package title, amount (฿), payment date, status badge
- Show Stripe Payment ID (truncated with copy functionality)
- Include credits received and transaction status
- Add hover effects and responsive design
- Status badges: สำเร็จ (success), ล้มเหลว (error), รอดำเนินการ (warning)
- Follow DaisyUI card-mystical styling conventions

**Visual Design:**
```typescript
// Card structure following MiMiVibes theme
<div className="card-mystical p-4 mb-4">
  <div className="flex justify-between items-start mb-3">
    // Package title + date
    // Amount + status badge
  </div>
  <div className="grid grid-cols-2 gap-4 text-sm">
    // Credits received + Payment ID
  </div>
</div>
```

### Task D: Hooks and Integration (30 minutes)
**Objective:** Create usePaymentHistory hook and integrate navigation

**Requirements:**
- Create `/src/hooks/usePaymentHistory.ts` adapting useHistory pattern
- Add loading, error, and data states
- Implement filtering state management
- Add navigation link to UnifiedNavbar (if needed)
- Ensure proper routing and page accessibility
- Test end-to-end functionality

## 📋 Technical Specifications

### Database Schema (Already Implemented ✅)
```typescript
// PaymentHistory table - ready for use
interface PaymentHistory {
  id: string;
  userId: string;
  stripePaymentId: string;
  packId: number;
  amount: number;           // Amount in cents/satang
  currency: string;         // "thb"
  status: string;           // "succeeded", "failed", "pending"
  creditsAdded: number;     // Stars added to account
  createdAt: Date;
  pack: Pack;               // Relation to Pack table
}
```

### API Response Interface
```typescript
interface PaymentHistoryResponse {
  success: boolean;
  data: {
    payments: PaymentHistoryItem[];
    pagination: {
      page: number;
      limit: number;
      total: number;
      totalPages: number;
      hasNextPage: boolean;
      hasPreviousPage: boolean;
    };
    summary: {
      totalAmount: number;
      totalCredits: number;
      totalTransactions: number;
      successRate: number;
    };
  };
}
```

### Filtering Capabilities
- **Date Range**: Start date to end date selection
- **Package Type**: Filter by specific packages (แพ็คเริ่มต้น, แพ็คคุ้มค่า, แพ็คพรีเมียม)
- **Payment Status**: succeeded, failed, pending
- **Amount Range**: Min/max amount filtering
- **Search**: By Stripe Payment ID

## 🎨 UI/UX Requirements

### Design Consistency
- Follow DaisyUI + MiMiVibes theme (card-mystical, primary colors)
- Use existing component patterns from /history page
- Maintain responsive design (mobile-first)
- Include proper loading states and skeleton components

### Mobile Optimization
- Cards in single column on mobile
- Touch-friendly filter controls
- Proper spacing with bottom navigation (pb-24 safe-area-bottom)
- Swipe gestures for navigation (if applicable)

### Status Indicators
```typescript
const StatusBadge = ({ status }: { status: string }) => {
  const styles = {
    succeeded: "badge-success",
    failed: "badge-error", 
    pending: "badge-warning"
  };
  
  const labels = {
    succeeded: "สำเร็จ",
    failed: "ล้มเหลว",
    pending: "รอดำเนินการ"
  };
};
```
