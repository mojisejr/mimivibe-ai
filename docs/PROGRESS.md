**Context Strategy:** CLAUDE.md + UI-COMPONENTS.md (~9,500 tokens)  
**Estimated Duration:** 4-5 hours  
**Priority:** Critical (New user experience)

**Planned Tasks:**

- [ ] **Task A**: New /ask page layout (hero + loading + article display)
- [ ] **Task B**: Auto-hide navbar + state management + component cleanup

**Success Criteria:**

- [ ] หน้า /ask เป็น single-page experience (ไม่ใช่ chat interface)
- [ ] Hero section: "ไพ่พร้อมแล้ว" + "บอกฉันสิ คุณอยากรู้อะไร?" design สวยงาม
- [ ] Loading state: "ทำใจให้สบาย... แม่หมอกำลังทำนาย" + real-time timer
- [ ] Auto-hide navbar on scroll (Framer Motion implementation)
- [ ] ลบ chat components เก่า (ChatContainer, ChatMessages, ChatInput, TypingIndicator)
- [ ] State management: initial → loading → result states
- [ ] Mobile responsive design maintained

/ask/components/
├── HeroSection.tsx      # Title + subtitle + input + stars counter
├── LoadingState.tsx     # Timer + loading message with animation
├── ArticleDisplay.tsx   # Medium.com style reading presentation
├── AutoHideNavbar.tsx   # Scroll-based navbar visibility
└── ActionButtons.tsx    # Save/Delete/Ask Again buttons
```

**Components to Remove:**

- ChatContainer.tsx (main chat orchestrator)
- ChatMessages.tsx (message routing system)
- ChatInput.tsx (chat textarea - extract reusable parts for HeroSection)
- TypingIndicator.tsx (chat loading state)
- Chat-related message components (UserMessage, AssistantMessage, etc.)

**Context Files:**

**Context Strategy:** CLAUDE.md + UI-COMPONENTS.md (~9,500 tokens)  
**Estimated Duration:** 3-4 hours  
**Priority:** High (User engagement)

**Planned Tasks:**

- [ ] **Task A**: Framer Motion animation sequence (cards flip + timed reveals)
- [ ] **Task B**: Error handling + save/delete actions + user flow completion

**Success Criteria:**

- [ ] Cards flip animation (3 second delay + 0.6s stagger between cards)
- [ ] Article-style reading display (Medium.com style with Thai typography)
- [ ] Animation sequence: question → header → cards → reading sections
- [ ] Save/Delete buttons with inline feedback (loading states + success animations)
- [ ] Error modals with retry/reset functionality (network, API, timeout errors)
- [ ] Complete user flow: hero → loading → animation → reading → actions → reset
- [ ] Animation fallbacks (graceful degradation if Framer Motion fails)

**Animation Timeline Implementation:**

```typescript
1. Question appear: fadeInUp (0.5s)
2. Header appear: fadeInUp (0.8s delay)
3. Cards appear: staggerChildren (1.2s delay)
4. Cards flip: rotateY animation (0.6s interval between cards)
5. Reading sections: fadeInUp (0.5s stagger)
6. Action buttons: slideUp (final reveal)
```

**Error Handling Strategy:**

- **API/Network Errors**: Modal error → "ลองใหม่" or "กลับหน้าหลัก" → Reset to initial state
- **Animation Failures**: Silent fallback → Skip animation → Continue to reading display
- **Credit Insufficient**: Specific modal → "ซื้อดาว" or "ดูประวัติ" actions
- **Input Validation**: Inline feedback (not modal) → Toast warnings

**Context Files:**

- `CLAUDE.md` (Master reference - 6,500 tokens)
