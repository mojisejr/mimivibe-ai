## üìù AI Diary

Recovering from an IDE unexpected closure required a systematic approach to understand where we left off. My strategy was to:

1. **Information Gathering**: First examined the git status and recent commits to understand what work had been completed
2. **Issue Context**: Reviewed the open GitHub issues #125 and #126 to understand the scope and requirements
3. **Code Analysis**: Examined the actual changes in AnimatedArticleDisplay.tsx and ReadingDetailModal.tsx to validate completeness
4. **Validation Protocol**: Ran builds and TypeScript checks to ensure code quality before proceeding

The recovery process revealed that the card data structure optimization work was actually complete and ready for delivery. The key insight was recognizing that `selectedCards` with complete Supabase URLs was the correct approach versus `cards` with filename-only paths that required complex fallback logic.

My decision to create a comprehensive commit message and detailed PR description was driven by the need to clearly document the technical changes for future reference, especially given the context of recovering from an unexpected closure.
