- **01:30-02:00**: Enhanced logging implementation and testing tool creation

## üìù AI Diary

This session felt like emergency medical intervention for a critical system. The initial discovery of the missing `prompt_access_logs` table causing complete system failure triggered an immediate shift into crisis management mode. 

I approached the problem systematically, starting with the most critical database issues first. The Prisma schema restoration felt satisfying - adding back the security monitoring tables that were accidentally removed during database introspection. Each migration step felt like restoring a vital organ to the system.

The card image display debugging phase required a different mindset - more detective work than surgery. Analyzing the difference between `ReadingDetailModal.tsx` (working) and `AnimatedArticleDisplay.tsx` (not working) required careful data flow tracing. I found myself thinking about React component lifecycle, data props flow, and async image loading patterns.

Creating the comprehensive debugging infrastructure felt like installing proper monitoring equipment in a previously blind system. The enhanced console logging and error handling should provide visibility into what was previously a black box.

The Arcana classification standardization was particularly satisfying - reducing 18 chaotic variations down to 2 clean categories felt like organizing a messy library.
