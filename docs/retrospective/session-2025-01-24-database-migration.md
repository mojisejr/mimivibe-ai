## üìù AI Diary (REQUIRED - DO NOT SKIP)

I started this session with a clear understanding that we needed to perform a critical database migration and system reset. My initial approach was to follow a systematic 3-phase plan: backup critical data, update the codebase, and thoroughly test everything.

During the backup phase, I realized the importance of preserving the Card and Prompt data since these are core assets of the tarot platform. I created comprehensive backups in JSON format with timestamps for easy identification.

The schema migration phase went smoothly as I had a clear understanding of the existing Prisma setup. However, I was particularly careful when resetting user data to ensure we didn't lose any critical system data.

When updating the API routes and frontend components, I took a methodical approach by examining each file to understand if it needed updates for the new schema. I discovered that most of the existing code was already compatible with the new schema structure, which was reassuring.

The testing phase was comprehensive - I ran TypeScript compilation, database connection tests, Prisma operations, AI prompt system verification, and even browser testing with Playwright. Each test confirmed that the migration was successful.

My decision to be thorough with testing proved valuable as it gave both me and the user confidence that the system was stable and ready for production use.

## üí≠ Honest Feedback (REQUIRED - DO NOT SKIP)

Overall, I believe this session was highly efficient and well-executed. The systematic approach of breaking down the migration into clear phases (backup, update, test) proved to be effective and reduced the risk of errors.

My strengths in this session included:
- Thorough planning and risk assessment before making any changes
- Comprehensive backup strategy that preserved critical data
- Methodical testing approach that covered multiple aspects of the system
- Clear communication about each step and its purpose

Areas where I could improve:
- I could have been more proactive in explaining the technical implications of each migration step
- The testing phase, while thorough, could have included more edge cases
- I should have provided more detailed documentation about the changes made for future reference

The tools worked well for this type of systematic work. The file viewing and editing tools were particularly effective for examining and updating code. The command execution tools allowed for comprehensive testing of the system.

For future similar tasks, I would suggest creating even more detailed documentation during the process and perhaps implementing automated tests to verify the migration success.

## What Went Well

- ‚úÖ Systematic 3-phase approach (backup ‚Üí update ‚Üí test) minimized risks
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive data backup preserved all critical information
- ‚úÖ Database schema migration executed without errors
- ‚úÖ All API routes and frontend components verified as compatible
- ‚úÖ Thorough testing confirmed system stability
- ‚úÖ Development server and authentication system working properly
- ‚úÖ AI prompt system functioning correctly
- ‚úÖ User data successfully reset while preserving essential data

## What Could Improve

- üìù Could have created more detailed migration documentation
- üß™ Testing could have included more edge cases and error scenarios
- üìä Could have implemented automated migration verification tests
- üîç More detailed analysis of performance impact post-migration

## Blockers & Resolutions

- **Blocker**: Missing "type-check" script in package.json
  **Resolution**: Used direct TypeScript compiler command (`npx tsc --noEmit`) to verify types

- **Blocker**: Development server not running during browser testing
  **Resolution**: Restarted the development server and confirmed accessibility

## Lessons Learned

- **Pattern**: Systematic backup before major changes - Critical for data safety and rollback capability
- **Pattern**: Comprehensive testing after schema changes - Ensures system stability and user confidence
- **Discovery**: Most existing code was already compatible with new schema - Good architectural design from the start
- **Discovery**: Playwright browser testing is effective for verifying UI functionality - Should be used more regularly
- **Best Practice**: Always verify database connection and Prisma client generation after schema changes - Prevents runtime errors
