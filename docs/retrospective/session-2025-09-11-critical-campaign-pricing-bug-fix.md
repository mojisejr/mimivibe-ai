## üìù AI Diary

Today I tackled one of the most critical bugs I've encountered - a pricing issue that was charging customers 100x more than intended. The user reported seeing 9900 in the database instead of the expected 99 THB, and I immediately recognized this as a production-critical issue.

My approach was systematic: first, I created context and plan issues to track the work properly. Then I dove deep into database investigation using Prisma Studio and custom scripts to understand the scope. The moment I ran the investigation query and saw the table showing prices like 9900, 19900, 39900 - all exactly 100x the expected values - I knew we had a data corruption issue rather than a code bug.

The fix itself was straightforward once identified: divide all prices by 100. But the validation was extensive. I created multiple test scripts to ensure the campaign discount system worked correctly with the fixed prices, validated the Stripe integration end-to-end, and confirmed the payment flow was accurate.

What struck me was how a seemingly simple database issue could have such massive customer impact. A customer trying to buy a 99 THB package with a 70% discount should pay 29.7 THB, but was actually being charged 2970 THB - still a 100x overcharge even with the discount!

The systematic approach with TodoWrite tracking helped me stay organized through the 8-phase implementation. Each phase built on the previous one, and the comprehensive validation at the end gave confidence that the fix was complete and correct.
