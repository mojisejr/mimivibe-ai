## üìù AI Diary

This was an exceptionally smooth implementation session that demonstrated the power of systematic analysis and TodoWrite integration. When I began the system analysis, I was pleasantly surprised to discover that the referral system was already well-architected with a dedicated URL utility - the issue was simply a hardcoded fallback domain and lack of request-context support.

My approach was methodical: I first conducted comprehensive searches to understand the referral ecosystem, then traced the exact URL generation flow. This revealed that the system was already using `getBaseUrl()` from `src/lib/utils/url.ts`, but the function needed enhancement for true dynamic detection.

The enhancement strategy was elegant - rather than rebuilding the entire system, I extended the existing utility with optional request parameter support. This allowed server-side URL detection from headers while maintaining full backward compatibility. The specialized `buildReferralUrl()` function provided a clean abstraction for referral-specific needs.

What made this implementation particularly satisfying was the cascading fallback system I implemented:
1. Client-side detection via `window.location.origin`
2. Server-side request headers (`x-forwarded-proto`, `host`)
3. Environment variables (`NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL`, `VERCEL_URL`)
4. Development fallback (`localhost:3000`)
5. Production fallback (`mimivibe.com`)

The TodoWrite integration proved invaluable for maintaining focus and providing stakeholder visibility. Breaking the work into 10 systematic todos prevented any steps from being missed and demonstrated clear progress throughout the session.
