# Session Retrospective - Package Pricing Display Fix

**Session Date**: January 24, 2025  
**Start Time**: ~10:30 AM  
**End Time**: ~11:15 AM  
**Duration**: ~45 minutes  
**Primary Focus**: Fix package pricing display issue (#39)  
**Current Issue**: #39 - Package pricing showing satoshi instead of THB  
**Last PR**: #40 - Fix package pricing display from satoshi to THB  

## Session Summary

Successfully resolved the package pricing display issue where prices were incorrectly showing in satoshi (9900) instead of Thai Baht (99). The problem was identified in the frontend components that were displaying raw database values without proper currency conversion. Fixed both `PricingCards.tsx` and `PackageCard.tsx` components to properly convert satoshi to THB while maintaining Stripe payment compatibility.

## Timeline

- 10:30 - Started session, reviewed issue #39 about incorrect pricing display
- 10:35 - Investigated `PricingCards.tsx` and identified direct price display without conversion
- 10:40 - Examined `PackageCard.tsx` and found `formatPrice` function needed modification
- 10:45 - Fixed `PricingCards.tsx` to convert satoshi to THB using division by 100
- 10:50 - Updated `PackageCard.tsx` formatPrice function for proper currency conversion
- 10:55 - Verified API still returns correct satoshi values for Stripe compatibility
- 11:00 - Committed changes and created Pull Request #40
- 11:05 - Started dev server and tested pricing display visually
- 11:10 - Confirmed all package prices display correctly in THB
- 11:15 - Work completed, all tasks marked as done

## üìù AI Diary (REQUIRED - DO NOT SKIP)

I started this session by examining the reported issue where package prices were displaying as 9900‡∏ø instead of 99‡∏ø. My initial understanding was that this was likely a currency conversion problem between the database storage format and frontend display.

As I investigated the codebase, I discovered that the database stores prices in satoshi (the smallest unit) for Stripe compatibility, but the frontend components were displaying these raw values without conversion. This made perfect sense from a technical standpoint - Stripe requires amounts in the smallest currency unit, so 99 THB becomes 9900 satoshi.

My approach evolved as I found two different components handling price display: `PricingCards.tsx` was directly showing `pkg.price` without any formatting, while `PackageCard.tsx` had a `formatPrice` function but wasn't converting from satoshi. I realized I needed to fix both components consistently.

The most confusing point initially was understanding why the database stored such large numbers, but once I confirmed this was the standard Stripe pattern, everything clicked into place. I made sure to preserve the satoshi values for payment processing while only converting for display purposes.

My decision to use `(pkg.price / 100).toLocaleString('th-TH')` in PricingCards and modify the formatPrice function in PackageCard was based on maintaining consistency across the application while using proper Thai locale formatting.

## üí≠ Honest Feedback (REQUIRED - DO NOT SKIP)

This session was highly efficient and well-executed. I quickly identified the root cause and implemented a clean solution without over-engineering. The systematic approach of checking both components, verifying API behavior, and testing the changes was thorough.

The tools worked excellently - code search helped locate all price-related components, file editing was smooth, and the git workflow functioned perfectly. The browser testing via Playwright confirmed the visual changes worked as expected.

My communication was clear and focused, explaining the technical reasoning behind storing prices in satoshi while displaying in THB. I maintained good separation of concerns by not modifying the payment flow.

One area for improvement: I could have been more proactive in checking for other potential price display locations in the codebase, though the regex search did catch the main components effectively.

Overall, this was a textbook example of identifying a problem, implementing a targeted fix, and thoroughly testing the solution. The 45-minute duration was appropriate for the scope of work.

## What Went Well

- Quick identification of the root cause (satoshi vs THB display issue)
- Clean, targeted fixes without affecting payment processing
- Thorough testing including API verification and visual confirmation
- Proper git workflow with descriptive commit messages and PR creation
- Maintained Stripe compatibility while fixing user-facing display
- Efficient use of search tools to locate all relevant code sections

## What Could Improve

- Could have done a more comprehensive search for other potential price display locations
- Might have benefited from checking if there are any admin interfaces that also display prices
- Could have added unit tests for the price conversion functions

## Blockers & Resolutions

- **Blocker**: Initial confusion about why prices were stored as large numbers  
  **Resolution**: Researched Stripe documentation and confirmed satoshi storage is standard practice

- **Blocker**: Dev server was stopped during testing  
  **Resolution**: Restarted the development server and successfully tested the changes

## Lessons Learned

- **Pattern**: Stripe integration requires storing amounts in smallest currency unit - Always check payment processor requirements when dealing with currency storage
- **Discovery**: Frontend price display needs explicit conversion from storage format - Don't assume database values are display-ready
- **Best Practice**: Separate storage format from display format for better maintainability - Keep payment processing and user interface concerns separate
