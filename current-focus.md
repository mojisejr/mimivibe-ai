**Focus**: Referral System Foreign Key Constraint Analysis - Timing Issue Between Clerk Authentication and Database Sync

## Session Context

### Issue Overview
Completed comprehensive analysis of critical bug in referral system where users don't receive referral bonuses due to foreign key constraint violations. The issue occurs when Clerk authentication completes but User record hasn't been synced to Supabase database via webhook yet.

### Key Findings
- **Root Cause**: Timing issue between Clerk authentication and database synchronization
- **Error Location**: `/src/app/api/referrals/process/route.ts:61-69` during ReferralCode creation
- **Technical Issue**: Foreign key constraint `referral_codes_userId_fkey` violation
- **Impact**: Users don't receive referral bonuses, poor UX with 500 errors

### Files Analyzed
- `/src/app/api/referrals/process/route.ts` (primary error location)
- `prisma/schema.prisma` (foreign key relationships)
- `/src/app/page.tsx` (referral processing flow)

### Status
Analysis phase completed. Ready for implementation planning to resolve timing synchronization issues and add proper user existence validation.
