## Current Session Context

Refactor Clerk webhook route @src/app/api/webhooks/clerk/route.ts DEFAULT_USER_VALUES inconsistency - analyze free trial credit system and refactor to use RewardConfiguration for consistency with user profile route, ensuring default fallback values are 0 stars and 3 freePoints

## Key Areas of Investigation

- DEFAULT_USER_VALUES hardcoded configuration in Clerk webhook
- Inconsistency between webhook (stars: 0, freePoint: 3) vs profile route dynamic values
- Free trial credit system analysis across user creation flows
- Consolidate reward configuration to use RewardConfiguration table
- Ensure consistent fallback values: 0 stars and 3 freePoints
