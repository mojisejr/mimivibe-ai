# Current Focus: i18n Internationalization Implementation

**Date**: 2025-09-21 23:59:34 (Thailand Time)
**Focus**: I wanted to implement i18n Internationlization to have 2 languages support, ENGLISH and THAI

## Context

The MiMiVibes AI-Powered Tarot Reading Platform needs internationalization support for two languages:
- English (default/fallback)
- Thai (primary target market)

This implementation will enable the platform to serve both English-speaking and Thai-speaking users with localized content, including:
- UI text and labels
- Tarot card reading content
- Form validation messages
- Navigation and interface elements
- Payment and transaction messages

## Technical Considerations

- Next.js 14 with App Router architecture
- TypeScript support for type-safe translations
- Integration with existing Tailwind CSS styling
- Compatibility with Clerk Auth multilingual support
- AI prompt localization for Thai tarot readings
- SEO optimization for both languages

## Current Status

Ready to begin analysis and planning for i18n implementation.
