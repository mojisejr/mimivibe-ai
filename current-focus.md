# Current Focus: Referral System Analysis and Dynamic URL Implementation

**Updated**: 2025-09-11 15:02:26 (Thailand Time)
**Status**: System Analysis - Referral System
**Priority**: HIGH - System Improvement

## Issue Description

Analyzing the referral system to identify and fix hardcoded link issues. The goal is to make the referral link generation dynamic based on the current URL that the system is running on.

- **Current Issue**: Referral links are hardcoded in the system
- **Target**: Dynamic URL generation based on current environment
- **Impact**: Referral system should work seamlessly across local, staging, and production environments

## Context

- User has identified hardcoded referral links in the system
- Need comprehensive analysis of referral system implementation
- Implement dynamic URL detection and generation
- Ensure proper functionality across different deployment environments

## Technical Investigation Areas

Key areas to analyze:
1. **Referral Link Generation**: Locate where referral links are currently hardcoded
2. **URL Detection**: Implement dynamic URL detection based on current environment
3. **System Integration**: Ensure referral links work across different deployment environments
4. **Environment Handling**: Support for localhost, staging, and production URLs

## Next Steps Required

1. Analyze current referral system implementation
2. Identify all hardcoded URL references
3. Implement dynamic URL generation logic
4. Test across different environments (local/staging/production)
5. Update documentation and ensure proper functionality

## Investigation Focus

**PRIMARY**: Comprehensive analysis of referral system to replace hardcoded links with dynamic URL generation based on current system environment.
