I need to encrypt my prompt, I don't need other to clone my prompt so I need to check all of my prompt system and all the Agent System for this risk, and I'm not sure that I have implemented this already or not I need to know it and need to implement this feature to secure my prompt you might need to check all the codebase and and database for the sake of clearly understand what we currently are

## Key Areas of Investigation

- Prompt security and encryption status
- AI Agent System security risks
- Database prompt storage analysis
- Codebase security assessment
- Implementation requirements for prompt protection
