# Current Focus - CLAUDE.md Enhancement with Retrospective Analysis

**Last Updated**: 2025-09-09 14:30:00 (Thailand Time)

## Current Session Context

Implementing comprehensive CLAUDE.md enhancement based on retrospective analysis from 17+ documented development sessions. This enhancement transforms CLAUDE.md from project documentation into a comprehensive knowledge base of proven implementation patterns, performance optimizations, security best practices, and workflow compliance strategies.

## Retrospective Analysis Completed

**Files Analyzed**: 17 retrospective files from `/docs/retrospective/` (2025-01-24 to 2025-09-09)
- UI consolidation and component refactoring sessions  
- Security implementations (AI prompt encryption, Stripe payment audit)
- Database migration and sequence management
- Workflow violations and their documented performance impact
- TodoWrite integration effectiveness analysis

## Key Enhancements Added to CLAUDE.md

### üìä Implementation Performance Benchmarks
- **Performance Categories**: 6 implementation types with documented time improvements (15-135 minutes)
- **Efficiency Indicators**: TodoWrite usage, reference patterns, systematic approaches
- **Proven Improvements**: UI consolidation 56% faster, security implementation 66% faster

### üîê Security Implementation Patterns
- **Enterprise-Grade Security Workflow**: 4-phase systematic approach with proven 66% time reduction
- **Performance Metrics**: 66 minutes vs 4-6 hours estimated for comprehensive encryption implementation
- **Compliance Achievements**: PCI DSS improvement from 65% to 85% in single session
- **Security Best Practices**: Systematic audit methodology with audit-quality documentation
