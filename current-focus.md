**Context**: redirect to /ask page for logged in user

## Description
Working on implementing automatic redirection functionality for logged-in users to be redirected to the /ask page instead of staying on the home page. This improves user experience by taking authenticated users directly to the main application functionality.

## Key Components
- Authentication flow modification in src/app/page.tsx
- Auto-redirect logic for signed-in users
- Preservation of existing referral flow
- Prevention of infinite redirect loops

## Status
Context saved and ready for implementation planning.
