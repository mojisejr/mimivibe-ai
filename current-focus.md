## Current Task
Implement Phase 1: เพิ่ม Conditional Routing from `/Users/non/dev/vibes/mimi-vibes-v3/docs/ask-error-plan.md`

## Context
Working on enhancing the LangGraph workflow error handling system by implementing conditional routing that allows the workflow to terminate early when errors occur, rather than continuing through all nodes. This is the first phase of a comprehensive error handling improvement plan.

## Key Implementation Areas
- Add conditional routing logic to workflow
- Create error handler node
- Implement shouldContinue function
- Update workflow graph with conditional edges
- Ensure early termination on errors
