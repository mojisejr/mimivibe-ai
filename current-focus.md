## Critical Security Issue - URGENT

**CRITICAL NPM PACKAGE VULNERABILITY DETECTED**

⚠️ **Security Alert**: NPM account of 'qix' (maintainer of critical packages like chalk, debug, strip-ansi, color-convert) was hijacked on 2025-09-08. Malicious versions containing crypto-clipper malware were published.

**Malware Impact**:

{
  "resolutions": {
    "chalk": "5.3.0",
    "strip-ansi": "7.1.0", 
    "color-convert": "2.0.1",
