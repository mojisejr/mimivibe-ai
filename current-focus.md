**Updated**: 2025-09-09 22:17:16 (Thailand Time)
**Status**: Critical Bug - Payment System
**Priority**: HIGH - Customer Impact

## Issue Description

Completed 70% off campaign implementation but discovered critical pricing calculation bug during purchase testing:

- **Expected**: ฿29.70 (70% discount applied to ฿99 package) 
- **Actual**: ฿2,970.00 (100x price inflation)
- **Package**: Starter package with 70% discount
- **Impact**: Critical - customers would be charged 100x more than intended

## Context

- 70% off campaign system is 70% complete
- Campaign detection and eligibility working
- Bug appears to be in Stripe payment amount calculation
- Likely decimal/currency unit conversion issue (baht vs satang)

## Technical Suspicion

Possible causes:
1. Currency unit conversion error (baht to satang multiplication)
2. Discount calculation applied incorrectly in payment flow
3. Stripe payment intent amount formatting issue

## Next Steps Required

1. Investigate payment calculation logic in campaign discount flow
2. Check Stripe payment amount conversion (baht → satang)
3. Verify discount application in payment creation
4. Test payment flow with corrected calculations
5. Ensure all packages work correctly with campaign discount

## Safety Priority

**CRITICAL**: This bug could result in customers being overcharged by 100x. Must be resolved before campaign goes live.
