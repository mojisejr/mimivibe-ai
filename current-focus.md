*Last updated: 2025-09-08 15:55:11*

## Session Status

**Current Issue**: Comprehensive Stripe implementation security audit and defect analysis
**Status**: üîç CRITICAL SECURITY REVIEW - Analyzing payment system for vulnerabilities, defects, and compliance issues

## Context Overview

Conducting a comprehensive security audit of the entire Stripe payment implementation to identify defects, malfunctions, security vulnerabilities, and critical issues that need immediate attention and resolution.

### Audit Scope

**Core Components Under Review**:
- `/api/payments/create-payment-intent.ts` - Payment creation endpoint
- `/api/payments/webhook.ts` - Stripe webhook handler  
- `/api/payments/history.ts` - Payment transaction history
- Frontend payment components and flows
- Database payment schemas and models
- Environment configuration and secrets

**Security Focus Areas**:
- API key exposure and rotation policies
- Webhook signature verification integrity
- Payment data sanitization and validation
- Transaction integrity and atomicity
- Error handling security implications
- CORS configuration and authentication
- PCI DSS compliance adherence

### Investigation Strategy

1. **Code Security Analysis**: Deep dive into all payment-related code
2. **Flow Vulnerability Testing**: End-to-end payment lifecycle security
3. **Data Validation Review**: Input sanitization and validation gaps
4. **Error Scenario Testing**: Security implications of failure modes
5. **Integration Security**: Webhook reliability and security
6. **Compliance Audit**: PCI DSS and security standard adherence

## Critical Areas of Concern

- **Secret Management**: API key handling and exposure risks
- **Webhook Security**: Signature verification and replay attack prevention  
- **Transaction Integrity**: Race conditions and double-processing
- **Data Protection**: PII handling and storage security
- **Error Disclosure**: Information leakage in error responses
- **Authentication**: Payment endpoint access control

## Expected Deliverables

- Security vulnerability assessment report
- Critical issue prioritization and impact analysis
- Implementation defect catalog with severity ratings
- Security enhancement recommendations
- Compliance gap analysis and remediation plan
