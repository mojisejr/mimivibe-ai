## Session Status

**Current Issue**: Temporarily Remove EXP Feature System
**Status**: ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS - Planning comprehensive removal of EXP features while preserving code structure for future reactivation

## Context Overview

Need to temporarily disable the entire EXP (experience points) feature system:

### Scope of EXP Feature Removal

**UI Components to Hide/Disable**:
- EXP progress bars and displays
- Level indicators and progression UI
- EXP gain notifications and animations
- Achievement XP rewards display
- Profile page EXP statistics

**Backend Logic to Disable**:
- EXP calculation and awarding
- Level progression logic
- EXP-based achievement triggers
- Automatic level-up processes
- EXP gain from readings, reviews, achievements

**Preservation Strategy**:
- Keep all database schema intact
- Maintain EXP-related API endpoints (return static/zero values)
- Preserve code structure with feature flags/comments
- Document all changes for easy reactivation
- Keep achievement system functional (without EXP components)

### Implementation Approach

The goal is to make EXP invisible to users while maintaining system stability and ensuring easy future reactivation through:

1. **Frontend**: Hide EXP UI elements with conditional rendering
2. **Backend**: Disable EXP calculations while keeping API structure
3. **Database**: Preserve all EXP data and schema
4. **Documentation**: Clear reversal path documentation

## Requirements

- **No UI EXP elements visible to users**
- **No EXP updating/calculation in backend**  
- **Code ready for future reactivation**
- **System stability maintained**
- **Achievement system continues working (non-EXP parts)**
