## ðŸ“š Modular Context Strategy

### Context File Architecture
```typescript
const contextArchitecture = {
  core: {
    file: "CLAUDE.md",
    purpose: "Master reference, always included",
    size: "~6,500 tokens",
    contains: ["Project overview", "Tech stack", "Business logic", "Round structure"]
  },
  
  supplements: {
    maxPerRound: 1,
    size: "~2,000-3,000 tokens each",
    totalPerRound: "~9,000 tokens (optimal for Claude)",
    
    files: {
      "UI-SYSTEM.md": "Design system, colors, typography, base components",
      "UI-COMPONENTS.md": "Chat UI, cards, complex interaction patterns", 
      "API-AUTH.md": "Authentication, user management, middleware",
      "API-READINGS.md": "LangGraph workflow, AI integration, reading system",
      "API-PAYMENTS.md": "Stripe integration, credit management, transactions",
      "API-FEATURES.md": "Gamification, daily rewards, referral system"
    }
  }
};
```

### Round-Specific Context Mapping
```typescript
const roundContextMap = {
  Round1: {
    files: ["CLAUDE.md", "UI-SYSTEM.md"],
    focus: "Foundation + Design System",
    tokens: "~9,000",
    rationale: "Need design system for theme setup and component structure"
  },
  
  Round2: {
    files: ["CLAUDE.md", "API-AUTH.md"], 
    focus: "Database + Authentication",
    tokens: "~8,500",
    rationale: "Need auth patterns and user management for database layer"
  },
  
  Round3: {
    files: ["CLAUDE.md", "API-READINGS.md"],
    focus: "LangGraph + AI Integration", 
    tokens: "~9,000",
    rationale: "Need complete AI workflow and reading generation patterns"
  },
  
  Round4: {
    files: ["CLAUDE.md", "UI-COMPONENTS.md"],
    focus: "Chat UI + User Experience",
    tokens: "~9,500", 
    rationale: "Need complex UI patterns for chat and card interactions"
  },
  
  Round5: {
    files: ["CLAUDE.md", "API-PAYMENTS.md"],
    focus: "Payment + Credit System",
    tokens: "~8,500",
    rationale: "Need Stripe integration and transaction management"
  },
  
  Round6: {
    files: ["CLAUDE.md", "API-FEATURES.md"],
    focus: "Gamification + Advanced Features", 
    tokens: "~9,000",
    rationale: "Need EXP system, campaigns, and referral logic"
  }
};
```

## ðŸ”„ Optimized Round Templates

### Round Execution Pattern (Updated)
```bash
# Optimized pattern with modular context
claude â†’ [paste CLAUDE.md + specific supplement file] â†’ implement â†’ test â†’ commit â†’ next round
```

### Round 1: Foundation Setup (COMPLETED âœ…)
**Status:** âœ… **COMPLETED** - January 2025  
**Context Files:** `CLAUDE.md` + `UI-SYSTEM.md`  
**Duration:** 2-3 hours (Actual)  
**Why This Combination:** Need project overview + design system for theming and component structure

**Completed Tasks:**
- **Task A**: âœ… Next.js 14 + Clerk authentication + LINE LIFF integration
- **Task B**: âœ… DaisyUI theme + MiMiVibes colors + responsive layout

**Context Scope:** 
- From CLAUDE.md: Project overview, tech stack, business objectives
- From UI-SYSTEM.md: Color system, typography, component patterns, responsive design

**Implementation Results:**
- âœ… Next.js 14 with TypeScript and App Router
- âœ… Clerk authentication configured with real API keys
- âœ… Complete routing structure: `/ask`, `/history`, `/profile`, `/packages`
- âœ… MiMiVibes custom theme with DaisyUI
- âœ… Mobile-first responsive design with safe areas
- âœ… Base component library (Button, Card, Input variants)
- âœ… Authentication middleware for protected routes
- âœ… Manual testing confirmed working

**Dependencies:** None  
**Success Criteria:** âœ… All completed successfully  
**Commit Hash:** `cd03406` - "feat(foundation): Next.js 14 + Clerk auth + MiMiVibes theme setup"

## ðŸš€ Simplified Round Prompt Template

### New Compact Round Prompt Format
```markdown
# Round [X]: [ROUND_NAME] 

**CONTEXT**: Read `CLAUDE.md` (master reference) + `[SUPPLEMENT_FILE].md` (round-specific)

## ðŸŽ¯ ROUND OBJECTIVE
[One-line objective from CLAUDE.md round mapping]

## ðŸ›  PAIRED TASKS  
**Task A**: [Task A description] ([specific files])
**Task B**: [Task B description] ([specific files])

## âœ… SUCCESS CRITERIA
- [ ] [Criterion 1]
- [ ] [Criterion 2] 
- [ ] [Criterion 3]

## ðŸ“‹ IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
[Only critical notes specific to this round from supplement file]

---
**Execute using Paired Sub-Agent Pattern**
**Test manually after completion**
**Commit with clear message**
```

### Benefits of New Template
- **50% shorter prompts**: Focus only on current round needs
- **Clearer context**: Exactly what files to read
- **Better focus**: No irrelevant information
- **Maintained quality**: All necessary context still provided
