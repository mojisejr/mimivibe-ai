# Iteration Notes for feature/238-reading-data-csv-export

## Iteration 1: 2025-09-26 23:54:08

**Summary of Actions:**
* Analyzed database schema (Reading, ReadingCard, Card, User models) and their relationships
* Reviewed AnimatedArticleDisplay component structure to understand required data format
* Created comprehensive export script `scripts/export-readings-to-csv.js` with data transformation
* Implemented UTF-8 BOM encoding for Thai language support in CSV output
* Created cleanup script `scripts/cleanup-exports.js` for managing temporary export files
* Added npm scripts to package.json for easy export and cleanup operations
* Successfully tested export functionality with production database (51 readings exported)
* Validated CSV output format matches AnimatedArticleDisplay component structure

**Issues and Solutions:**
* **Issue Found:** Initial script failed due to missing DATABASE_URL environment variable
* **Solution Applied:** Added dotenv configuration to load .env.local file before Prisma initialization
* **Issue Found:** npm scripts failed due to missing dotenv-cli package
* **Solution Applied:** Installed dotenv-cli as dev dependency and configured proper npm scripts
* **New Insight/Change:** Export generates timestamped CSV files with comprehensive reading data including card details, user info, and structured content fields

**Technical Implementation Details:**
* **Database Schema Analysis:** Identified key relationships between Reading → ReadingCard → Card models
* **Data Transformation:** Implemented JSON parsing for answer field to extract structured reading content
* **CSV Structure:** 40 columns including Reading ID, User ID, Question, timestamps, status flags, and detailed card information (up to 5 cards)
* **File Management:** Auto-creates exports/ directory with timestamped filenames
* **Security:** Uses environment variables for database connection, no sensitive data in code
* **Performance:** Successfully processed 51 readings generating 190.36 KB CSV file

**Files Created/Modified:**
* `scripts/export-readings-to-csv.js` - Main export script with comprehensive data transformation
* `scripts/cleanup-exports.js` - Cleanup utility for managing export files
* `package.json` - Added export:readings, export:cleanup, export:cleanup-all scripts
* `exports/` directory - Auto-created with timestamped CSV files

**Testing Results:**
* ✅ Database connection successful with production PostgreSQL
* ✅ Data export completed: 51 readings processed
* ✅ CSV format validation: Headers match AnimatedArticleDisplay structure
* ✅ Thai language support: UTF-8 BOM encoding working correctly
* ✅ npm scripts functional: All three export commands working
* ✅ Cleanup script operational: Proper file age detection and removal
